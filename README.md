Eat-Da-Burger app

Link to live deployment: https://immense-gorge-82354.herokuapp.com/

This application utilizes the full-stack to create a burger and devour-it, sending burger data from the front-end to the database and updating boolean values once the burger is devoured.

Technology & Languages used: 

 - HTML & CSS for the Front-end
 - Handlebars
 - Body-Parser
 - MySQL Database for the Backend
 - Express for the Server
 - MVC(Model-View-Controller) folder organization
 
How it works: Start by typing in the name of a burger in the search box below and click the "Add Burger" button. The Burger that you created will be added underneath the "Burgers Not Devoured" header. You will then have the option to Devour-it. Once you click the "Devour it" button, the burgur will move location and appear under "Burgers Devoured".

How it runs: Clone this repository. Run NPM install. Use MYSQL Workbench and populate the database by adding burgers inside of the app.
